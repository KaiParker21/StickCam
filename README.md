# 🎥 StickCam - Pose Detection & Visualizer Android App

StickCam is an Android application that visualizes human poses in real-time using stick figures, outlines, and raw camera feed. Built with Jetpack Compose, CameraX, and pose estimation models — it provides an intuitive interface for switching between modes and visualizing detected poses.

> 📌 **Note:** StickCam works best when the full body is visible in the camera view. The app allows full customization of colors, line widths, visibility of keypoints, numbers, and background color for an enhanced user experience.
